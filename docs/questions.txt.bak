Alteration in the developmental expression of genes has been suggested as a means of "curing" some genetic diseases. One such possibility is the re-expression of the fetal hemoglobin gene in patients with sickle cell anemia (HbS). A major difference between fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and normal adult hemoglobin (HbA) is that HbF binds oxygen tighter than does HbA. Myoglobin is another oxygen carrying protein found in the cell. A significant difference between myoglobin and hemoglobin is
